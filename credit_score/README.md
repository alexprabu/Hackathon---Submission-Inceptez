# Credit Score Prediction
Data 

We provide you with a data set in CSV format. 
The data set contains 8,000 train instances and 2000 test instance
There are 304 input features, labeled x001 to x304. 

The target variable is labeled y. 

Task Create a model to predict the target variable y. 

1. A report  - A Power point presentation
2. Any custom code you used 
3. Instructions for me to run your model on a separate data set 


What should be in the report? 

1. List of any assumptions that you made 
2. Description of your methodology and solution path 
3. List of algorithms and techniques you used 
4. List of tools and frameworks you used 
5. Results and evaluation of your models 

How to evaluate the model 
1. Use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 
2. If the absolute error of a prediction is greater than 4.0, I regard the prediction as "wrong". Otherwise, it is "correct". 
3. Any other evaluation measure that you believe is appropriate.
